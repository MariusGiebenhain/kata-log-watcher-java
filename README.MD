# Log Watcher

In this exercise, you'll start things off by writing a unit test for LogWatcher.java. You want to make sure that the
watcher sends out a notification mail when a new log message is available.


# Aufgabe 1
What makes writing that test hard to do?


# Aufgabe 2

Then, things start to get complicated as new requirements gradually come in.

* The subscribers get annoyed, because they're flooded with mails.
  Only alert them if an actual error occured.
* New developers (Antonio Materazzo and Fritz Schnitzel) join the team and need to be notified, too.
* Robert Glaser wants to be notified only, if the infamous exception code 42 occurs.
* Robert Glaser notices, that he needs way more information when a 42 occurs. So if that happens, he
  wants to receive the trace output preceding the exception.
* The developers have a group chat. During the working hours (8h - 17h) they'd like a chat bot to
  notify them of everything but debug output.
* On weekends, there's always one developer on standby. The guys rotate the dev with log-duty.
  If more than 10 errors pile up, he needs to be notified via all available channels.
